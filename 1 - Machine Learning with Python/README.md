In this project is required to write Python code in a iPython Notebook building a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not using the following algorithms:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass
