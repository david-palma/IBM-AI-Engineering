# Scalable Machine Learning on Big Data using Apache Spark

In this project is required to write Python code in a iPython Notebook to analyse a real-world dataset and apply machine learning on it using Apache Spark.

**Note:**
You will practice running machine learning tasks hands-on on an Apache Spark cluster provided by IBM at no charge during the course which you can continue to use afterwards.
